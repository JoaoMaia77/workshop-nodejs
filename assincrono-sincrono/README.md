As of my last update in January 2022, Node.js core modules are those modules that are shipped with the Node.js runtime and do not need to be separately installed using npm. Here's a list of core modules in Node.js:

assert: Provides a set of assertion functions for verifying invariants.

async_hooks: Allows tracking asynchronous resources within the Node.js application.

buffer: Provides functionalities for working with binary data.

child_process: Allows the creation of child processes.

cluster: Enables the creation of child processes to share server ports.

crypto: Provides cryptographic functionality.

dgram: Supports UDP (User Datagram Protocol) datagram sockets.

dns: Provides functions to perform DNS (Domain Name System) lookups and name resolution functions.

events: Implements the EventEmitter class for handling events.

fs: Provides file system-related operations.

http: Provides functionality to create HTTP servers and clients.

https: Provides functionality to create HTTPS servers and clients.

net: Provides an asynchronous network API for creating stream-based TCP or IPC servers and clients.

os: Provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

path: Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

perf_hooks: Provides performance monitoring and tracing utilities.

process: Provides information about the current Node.js process.

querystring: Provides utilities for parsing and formatting URL query strings.

readline: Provides an interface for reading input from a readable stream (such as the process.stdin stream) one line at a time.

repl: Implements a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) for interactive JavaScript execution.

stream: Provides an API for implementing the stream interface.

string_decoder: Provides an API for decoding buffer objects into strings.

timers: Provides functions to schedule timers.

tls: Provides an implementation of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocols.

trace_events: Provides a mechanism to trace asynchronous events.

tty: Provides classes used by the TTY (teletypewriter) subsystem.

url: Provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.

util: Provides utility functions and objects commonly used for debugging, testing, and other purposes.

v8: Provides access to the V8 JavaScript engine's API.

vm: Provides a way to compile and run JavaScript code within the current Node.js process.

zlib: Provides compression and decompression functionalities using zlib.

These are the core modules available in Node.js as of my last update. Keep in mind that Node.js may have introduced new modules or made changes since then.
